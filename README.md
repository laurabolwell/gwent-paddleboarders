# GWENT PADDLEBOARDERS

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

Milestone Project 1 - User-Centric Frontend Development

The project is a website for a social group of paddleboarders based in South Wales. The group originally started as a Facebook group, but has rapidly grown to over 1400 members and as a result the important information about paddleboarding meet-ups is becoming lost in the general chat on the page. 

The site provides some basic information about the group but the main focus is to provide information about the meet-ups which take place each week. It also shows some photographs from previous social paddles and has a contact page should a user wish to get in touch.

The website is designed to be fully responsive, allowing visitors to view it on a wide range of devices.

I used [https://ui.dev/amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://laurabolwell.github.io/gwent-paddleboarders) to create this image.

## UX

The end user of this project are paddleboarders in South Wales who wish to paddle with the group. The users range in age from 18 to 60 and the site would mainly be accessed on mobile devices. 

The end user wants to be able to find out details of social paddles taking place and how to join one. 
Other features are that the user will be able to see photographs of recent paddles, see maps and current weather conditions at paddle locations, get in touch with the organisers, and easily navigate to the group's social media pages.

### Colour Scheme

![coolors-palette](documentation/coolors-palette.png)

The website uses a palette of blues to tie in with the water theme and to give a sense of calm. I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/023047-227596-bce1f0-ffffff) to generate my colour palette.

- \#023047 used as the background for the navbar and footer, and used for text, headings, and buttons.
- \#227596 used as a background for sections of the page, for block dividing lines, and for buttons.
- \#BCE1F0 used for hover effects.
- \#FFFFFF used as a background for sections of the page, block dividing lines, and for text on non-white backgrounds.

I've used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
    --navy: #023047;
    --mid-blue: #227596;
    --light-blue: #BCE1F0;
    --white: #FFF;
}
```

### Typography

Google Fonts:
* [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for headings and the navbar.
* [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) was used for the body text.

[Font Awesome](www.fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.


## User Stories

### New Site Users

- As a new site user, I would like to find out what the group is about, so that I can see if it would be suitable for me to join.
- As a new site user, I would like to view photos of previous paddles, so that I can get a feel for if the group would be suitable for me.
- As a new site user, I would like to find out where and when the group meets, so that I can join the group.
- As a new site user, I would like to find out how to join a group paddle and if there is any cost, so that I can join the group.
- As a new site user, I would like to find out about parking at paddle locations, so that I will know where to park my car when I join the group.
- As a new site user, I would like to contact the group organisers, so that I can ask any other questions I may have.

### Returning Site Users

- As a returning site user, I would like to find the schedule, so that I can check the times of group paddles.
- As a returning site user, I would like to check the weather conditions at paddle spots, so that I can decide whether to join a particular paddle.
- As a returning site user, I would like to view photogaphs of social paddles, so that I can show family and friends.
- As a returning site user, I would like to contact the group organisers, so that I can suggest new paddle locations.
- As a returning site user, I would like to easily find the group's social media pages, so that I can connect with other paddlers in the group.

### Site Admin

- As a site administrator, I should be able to have all paddle information displayed, so that I can update all members and potential members on locations, times and other details eg parking costs.
- As a site administrator, I should be able to have images on the site, so that existing members can see photos of themselves from previous paddles and new members can see what our paddles are about.
- As a site administrator, I should be able to be contacted by both new and existing members, so that I can listen to any suggestions or answer any queries they may have.

## Wireframes

In this section, display your wireframe screenshots using a Markdown `table`.

Instructions on how to do Markdown `tables` start on line #213 on this site: https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.
